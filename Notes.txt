1. Entropy - Measure of impurity in a set of examples. Generally the opposite of purity.

1. So far we saw outputs being restricted to binary values (fast/ slow, light/heavy etc.) but now we will be dealing with continuous values - like, with increase in height, the weight also increases.
2. Here the output is continuous - hence called Continuous Supervised Learning.
3. Be clear, the output is now continuous. the input was continuous all along, and there are no changes there.
4. You do regressions when you have to predict continuous output values.

Linear Regression Example

from sklearn import linear_model
reg = linear_model.LinearRegression()
reg.fit(ages_train, net_worth_train)
reg.predict(ages_test) # ages_test -> [25,1,44,...]
# we can get the slope and y-intercept by
intercept = reg.intercept_
slope = reg.slope_

```

How to measure the effectiveness of the regression model which we just saw now?
1. R-squared score
```
# r sq score on test data
reg.score(ages_test, net_worth_test)
```
2. Sum of errors
3. General way to evaluate - ` error = actual value - predicted value`.

There are various algorithms that are there which minimize the sum of the squared error
  1. Ordinary Least Squares - OLS
  2. Gradient Descent
